## python_FileMovement_exercises

This is a series of exercises which build upon one another. The first (python_FileMover_drill_py2) is a script that moves files from one folder to another. The second (python_automate_fileCheck_and_fileMove) checks to see what files have been modified in the last 24 hours and only moves those files from the source folder to destnation folder. These were done in Python 2. The third (py3_GUI_with_FileCheckandMove, python_fileCheck_and_fileMove_mod) includes a GUI with UI controls for this file transfer. The fourth (py3_gui_and_db, fileCheck_and_fileMove_mod) incorporates interaction with a database using SQLite. Tasks 3 and 4 were done in Python 3.
